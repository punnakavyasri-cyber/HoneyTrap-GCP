# HoneyTrap-GCP 🐝🔐

HoneyTrap-GCP is an Infrastructure-as-Code project that provisions a honeypot lab on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** using **Terraform**. The environment aims to capture real-world attacker behaviour in a controlled cloud setting so you can practise SOC analysis, detection engineering, and incident investigation.  

This repository bootstraps networking, compute, and firewall resources, deploys a public-facing honeypot (T-Pot CE) and a restricted admin VM, and hosts a Dockerized **Kibana/Elastic** dashboard for visualizing collected telemetry. The deployment is partially complete: the dashboards are deployed but the Threat Analysis phase (explore Elastic, enumerate attackers, map strategies) is still pending and documented as the next milestone.


## 🎯 Purpose of the project
- Deploy a repeatable honeypot environment in GCP using Terraform.  
- Provide an isolated, observable environment to collect attacker telemetry.  
- Surface attacker activity into Elastic/Kibana for visualization and analysis.  
- Practice SOC workflows: detection → triage → investigation → reporting.  
- Build a foundation for IDS/Suricata, SIEM, and enrichment integrations.  
- Produce actionable findings (IOCs, attacker TTPs, timeline of compromise).

## 📋 Technologies used
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** — compute & networking  
- **Terraform** — IaC for VPC, firewall, VM provisioning  
- **T-Pot CE** (telekom-security) — multi-honeypot framework (credit below)  
- **Docker** — run Kibana/Elastic containers (local or admin VM)  
- **Kibana / Elastic** — log visualization & analysis 


## 📋 Pre-requisites
- A free **GCP account** with billing enabled  
- **Terraform CLI** installed on your machine  
- **gcloud CLI** installed and configured with GCP account  


## 🚀 Project workflow
1. Begin by creating a **Service Account** in GCP with the required IAM roles, and then download the key JSON file for authentication.  
2. Save the downloaded key JSON file securely on your local machine and either reference it directly in the Terraform provider configuration or authenticate using `gcloud auth application-default login`.  
3. Prepare the `terraform.tfvars` file by filling in the necessary variables, making use of the provided `terraform.tfvars.example` as a template to ensure consistency.  
4. Initialize and execute Terraform by running `terraform init`, followed by `terraform plan` to review the changes, and finally `terraform apply` to provision the VPC, firewall rules, and virtual machines.  
5. Once the infrastructure is deployed, provision both the Admin VM (with SSH restricted to your defined admin CIDR) and the Honeypot VM (public-facing) which automatically deploys the T-Pot CE honeypot components.  
6. On the Admin VM, deploy Kibana by running it inside a Docker container and configure it to connect with the Elastic data sources that capture the honeypot telemetry.  
7. Finally, open Kibana in your browser, validate that the dashboards are loading correctly, and begin the process of Threat Analysis by exploring attacker traffic, behaviors, and strategies.

**Notes about the current status of project:**  
- Dashboards (Elastic/Kibana) are deployed — ✅  
- Next: *explore the dashboard to identify who attacked the honeypot, what they attempted, and map their strategy (TTPs/IOC extraction)* — 🔎

**Planned analysis activities to keep in mind while exploring Elastic:**
- Inspect high-volume source IPs and timelines.  
- Query for common attack vectors (SSH brute force, HTTP exploit attempts, scanning, CVE probes).  
- Extract indicators: IPs, domains, user-agents, payloads, file hashes.  
- Map observed activity to **MITRE ATT&CK** tactics & techniques.  
- Reconstruct attacker session timelines and pivot between logs (suricata, syslog, docker logs, connection records).  
- Prepare a short report per attacker group: summary, IOCs, suggested detections, and containment steps.


## 🔮 Future Expansions
- Explore attacker data in Kibana and document findings.  
- Add basic alerting for suspicious activity.  
- Expand with more security tools (e.g., Suricata) in the future.  
- Create simple reports to share attack trends.  
- Automate parts of the deployment with Terraform or GitHub Actions.

## ✅ Quick security checklist (do this before committing)
- Remove or replace any real values in `terraform.tfvars` with placeholders (commit `terraform.tfvars.example` instead).  
- Add the following to `.gitignore`: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate`, `*.tfstate.backup`, `terraform.tfvars`, `*.json`, `*.pem`
